# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issue
The Vercel deployment was failing due to npm dependency conflicts between OpenTelemetry packages and Sentry.

## Resolution
1. **Removed all OpenTelemetry dependencies** from package.json:
   - @opentelemetry/api
   - @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node
   - @opentelemetry/exporter-metrics-otlp-http
   - @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http
   - @opentelemetry/instrumentation
   - @opentelemetry/instrumentation-fetch
   - @opentelemetry/instrumentation-http
   - @opentelemetry/resources
   - @opentelemetry/sdk-metrics
   - @opentelemetry/sdk-node
   - @opentelemetry/semantic-conventions

2. **Regenerated package-lock.json** to ensure clean dependency tree

3. **Verified build** still completes successfully

## Monitoring Strategy
- **Sentry** provides all necessary monitoring capabilities:
  - Error tracking
  - Performance monitoring
  - User session tracking
  - Custom metrics
  
- OpenTelemetry was redundant with Sentry's built-in instrumentation

## Deployment Instructions
1. Push the latest changes to your repository
2. Vercel will automatically redeploy
3. The deployment should now succeed without dependency conflicts

## Verification
After deployment:
1. Check Sentry dashboard for proper error tracking
2. Verify performance metrics are being collected
3. Test application functionality

The application maintains full monitoring capabilities through Sentry without needing separate OpenTelemetry packages.
