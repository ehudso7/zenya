- Use Unity's Debug class for logging and debugging (e.g., Debug.Log, Debug.LogWarning, Debug.LogError).
- Utilize Unity's profiler and frame debugger to identify and resolve performance issues.
- Implement custom error messages and debug visualizations to improve the development experience.
- Use Unity's assertion system (Debug.Assert) to catch logical errors during development.

### Dependencies

- Unity Engine
- .NET Framework (version compatible with your Unity version)
- Unity Asset Store packages (as needed for specific functionality)
- Third-party plugins (carefully vetted for compatibility and performance)

### Unity-Specific Guidelines

- Use Prefabs for reusable game objects and UI elements.
- Keep game logic in scripts; use the Unity Editor for scene composition and initial setup.
- Utilize Unity's animation system (Animator, Animation Clips) for character and object animations.
- Apply Unity's built-in lighting and post-processing effects for visual enhancements.
- Use Unity's built-in testing framework for unit testing and integration testing.
- Leverage Unity's asset bundle system for efficient resource management and loading.
- Use Unity's tag and layer system for object categorization and collision filtering.

### Performance Optimization

- Use object pooling for frequently instantiated and destroyed objects.
- Optimize draw calls by batching materials and using atlases for sprites and UI elements.
- Implement level of detail (LOD) systems for complex 3D models to improve rendering performance.
- Use Unity's Job System and Burst Compiler for CPU-intensive operations.
- Optimize physics performance by using simplified collision meshes and adjusting fixed timestep.

### Key Conventions

1. Follow Unity's component-based architecture for modular and reusable game elements.
2. Prioritize performance optimization and memory management in every stage of development.
3. Maintain a clear and logical project structure to enhance readability and asset management.
