## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Setting Up Monitoring

1. **Datadog**:
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DATADOG_APPLICATION_ID=your_app_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DATADOG_CLIENT_TOKEN=your_client_token
   DD_AGENT_HOST=your_agent_host
   ```

2. **Feature Flags**:
   ```bash
   # Set Unleash configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_UNLEASH_URL=your_unleash_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_UNLEASH_CLIENT_KEY=your_client_key
   ```

### Running Tests

1. **E2E Tests**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   # or for specific browser
   npx playwright test --project=chromium
   ```

2. **Load Tests**:
   ```bash
   # Install k6
   brew install k6
   
   # Run load test
   k6 run k6/load-test.js
   
   # Run stress test
   k6 run k6/stress-test.js
   ```

### Security Scanning

1. **Local Scanning**:
   ```bash
   # Install Snyk
   npm install -g snyk
   
   # Run security scan
   snyk test
   
   # Monitor for vulnerabilities
   snyk monitor
   ```

2. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Security scans run automatically on every push
   - Daily scheduled scans for new vulnerabilities
   - Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab

### Infrastructure Deployment

1. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Plan Changes**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan -out=tfplan
   ```

3. **Apply Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply tfplan
   ```
