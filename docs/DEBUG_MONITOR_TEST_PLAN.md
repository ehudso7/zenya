# Debug Monitor Test Plan - Production Grade

## Overview
Comprehensive test plan to ensure the debug monitor meets god-tier production standards (10.0 evaluation).

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Connection Tests
- [ ] Monitor connects immediately on page load
- [ ] Connection survives page refreshes
- [ ] Auto-reconnect works after connection loss
- [ ] Multiple monitors can connect simultaneously
- [ ] Session IDs are unique and persistent

### 2. Log Capture Tests
- [ ] Regular logs are captured and displayed
- [ ] Error logs are captured with proper formatting
- [ ] API calls (success and failure) are logged
- [ ] User interactions are tracked
- [ ] Performance metrics are recorded
- [ ] State changes are logged

### 3. Error Handling Tests
- [ ] Circular references don't cause stack overflow
- [ ] Large payloads are handled gracefully
- [ ] Network errors don't crash the monitor
- [ ] Invalid data doesn't break the display

### 4. UI/UX Tests
- [ ] Logs are color-coded by type
- [ ] Timestamps are accurate and readable
- [ ] Filtering works correctly
- [ ] Pause/Resume functionality works
- [ ] Download logs exports valid JSON
- [ ] Clear logs removes all entries
- [ ] Auto-scroll works when not paused

### 5. Performance Tests
- [ ] Monitor handles 1000+ logs without lag
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable
- [ ] No memory leaks over time
- [ ] CPU usage is minimal

### 6. Integration Tests
- [ ] Works with all API endpoints
- [ ] Captures errors from all app components
- [ ] Debug logger initialization is automatic
- [ ] CSRF errors are properly logged
- [ ] Authentication errors are captured

### 7. Production Readiness
- [ ] No console errors in production mode
- [ ] Security: Only works on localhost/dev
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed
- [ ] Graceful degradation if disabled
