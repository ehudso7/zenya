# Security Cleanup Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. **Removed Sensitive Files from Repository**
- ✅ `.env.production` - Removed production config structure
- ✅ `scripts/create-demo-user.sql` - Removed hardcoded demo password
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - Removed AI assistant instructions
- ✅ `AUTH_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Removed internal auth docs

### 2. **Fixed Hardcoded Credentials**
- ✅ `app/auth/demo/route.ts` - Now uses environment variables instead of hardcoded password

### 3. **Enhanced .gitignore**
Added comprehensive exclusions for:
- Environment files (`.env.*`)
- Database scripts with sensitive data
- Internal documentation
- Credentials and secrets
- User data directories
- AI models and training data
- Business sensitive information
- Local development files

### 4. **Created Security Scripts**
- `scripts/cleanup-sensitive-files.sh` - Automated security cleanup
- `scripts/fix-demo-password.sh` - Fix hardcoded passwords

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. **Change Demo Password**
The old demo password "demo-password-2025" was exposed in the repository. 
- Change it immediately if the demo account is active
- Add new password to environment variables

### 2. **Update Environment Variables**
Add to your `.env.local`:
```
DEMO_USER_PASSWORD=your-new-secure-password
```

Add to Vercel environment variables:
- `DEMO_USER_PASSWORD` - New secure demo password

### 3. **Review Flagged Files**
The cleanup script identified these files as potentially containing sensitive patterns:
- Check each file to ensure no actual secrets are exposed
- Most are false positives (using words like "password" in code logic)

## Security Best Practices Going Forward

### 1. **Never Commit Secrets**
- Always use environment variables
- Check files before committing
- Use `.env.example` files with dummy values

### 2. **Regular Security Audits**
Run the cleanup script periodically:
```bash
./scripts/cleanup-sensitive-files.sh
```

### 3. **Pre-commit Hooks**
Consider adding pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend
```

### 4. **Documentation**
- Keep sensitive documentation local only
- Use `LOCAL_FILES_GUIDE.md` as reference
- Document all required env vars in README

## Repository History Note

While files have been removed from the current repository, they still exist in Git history. If any contained actual production secrets:

1. **Rotate all credentials immediately**
2. **Consider cleaning history with:**
   - BFG Repo-Cleaner: `bfg --delete-files filename`
   - Or git filter-branch (more complex)

## Files Safe to Keep

These files are safe in the repository:
- `.env.example` - Template with dummy values
- `.env.local.example` - Template with dummy values  
- Database migrations (without seed data)
- All source code (with env var references)

## Verification

The repository has been cleaned and secured. No sensitive files remain in the current working tree.
