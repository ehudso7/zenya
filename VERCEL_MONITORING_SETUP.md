3. **Zero Performance Impact** - Minimal bundle size addition (~1KB)
4. **Automatic Updates** - Metrics collected on every deployment

### Next Steps:

1. **Deploy to Vercel**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

2. **View Analytics**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Navigate to the Analytics tab
   - Data will appear within 30 seconds of first visits

3. **View Speed Insights**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Navigate to the Speed Insights tab
   - Performance data collected automatically

### Troubleshooting:

If data doesn't appear after deployment:
1. Check for ad blockers or privacy extensions
2. Navigate between pages on your site
3. Ensure the deployment is on Vercel (not local)
4. Check the Vercel dashboard for any configuration issues

### Additional Configuration (Optional):

You can customize the behavior by passing options:

```tsx
// For Analytics
<Analytics
  beforeSend={(event) => {
    // Modify or filter events
    return event
  }}
/>

// For Speed Insights
<SpeedInsights
  sampleRate={1.0} // Sample 100% of page views
/>
```

The monitoring setup is now complete and will start collecting data as soon as the application is deployed to Vercel!
